Haplotypes_unaligned_nt.fasta is pulled from Arjen's spreadsheet data. African lab reared samples (F1's) are collapsed into singletons since they artificially increase the number of redundant alleles. Similarly singleton haplotypes from the resulting Leiden and Liverpool stocks are included as 'pseudoindividuals' to depict their position within the overall haplotype network
